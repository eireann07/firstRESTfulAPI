# RESTfulAPI: Jane Austen

Wiki-style API that hold data about characters in Jane Austen's *Pride and Prejudice*
- Written in JavaScript
- No front-end, Postman used for testing and HTTP commands
- Node and Express back-end
- MongoDB with Studio 3T


**What I enjoyed while building this app:** I really enjoyed working with Studio 3T! It was so easy to figure out, and I felt so accomplished when I was able to see entries update or successfully pull information from my basic API.

**What I struggled with while building this app:** Similar to my experience with the sign-up page I built, a lot of the information from the assignment instructions has deprecated, so having to figure out what those changes looked like on a new interface was a bit confusing, but also reassuring because I was able to successfully figure out those things on my own using documentation and Stack Overflow.

**Things I learned through building this app:** The streamlining that RESTful APIs implement is so helpful because it clearly reflection database CRUD command language, so it's very easy to understand what is happening as you call or build an API.
